Today, we are announcing a new way to take control over your company's profle on Honeypot. We recently launched an all new profile page where your organization can present itself to developers. Until now these pages were curated by Honeypot's Customer Success team based on your feedback. Now, we are opening them to be directly managed by you.

Honeypot's mission is to get every developer a great job and we believe to do so it is important that developers have extensive, up-to-date information about a potential employer. For companies competing for in-demand developers presenting themselves, their product, tech stack and team is the name of the game as salary and free Mate are less and less of a distinction.

### What's important?

When a developer receives your invitation for an interview on Honeypot, they don't just see the job you offer but also your company profile. The things that many developers care about are:
* The product - What are you building? What is the impact you want to have?
* The team - Who are the would-be team members? Do they have open source contributions? Are they involved in meet ups?
* The perks - Free Mate? Hackathons? An office dog?
* The tech stack - Will they work with Ruby or PHP? MySQL or Postgresql? 

### Soo, where to start?

You can find and edit your company profile by accessing it from the dropdown in the navigation bar:

Happy editing!
