Type “what is DevOps” into Google and a staggering amount of responses show. Considering this is a relatively new term and job function in IT, it has become a bit of a buzzword, there still seems to be great confusion as to what the actual role of DevOps really is?

## A History of DevOps
The earliest mentions of DevOps date back to the 2008 Agile Conference and a talk on Agile Infrastructure by Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois. At that time, businesses were experiencing a lot of problems with their tech infrastructure because the various departments weren’t effectively working together. Developers would write code in complete isolation of the final product, which essentially meant that more often than not, code wasn’t actually compatible with the product environment. This of course caused a lot of problems in relations to deployment, bug fixes - you name it - which left System Admin guys spread thin, and developers and product owners annoyed.

Naturally this process was neither smooth or efficient, so having deployment times of up to 2-3 weeks was far from uncommon. So when the Agile movement first revolutionised the it industry, it was hard to believe that you could go from one deployment every 2-3 weeks to 10 deployments per day. Since then DevOps and Agile has kept pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and today companies like Amazon will do several thousands deployments per day. In fact, they are said to be doing one deployment every **11.6 seconds!** 

## Does DevOps replace System Admin? 

As there is no globally accepted definition of DevOps, what we are experiencing first hand here at Honeypot is former System Admin people moving into the role of DevOps. However, there seems to be a common misconception that DevOps is merely System Admin repackaged and with fancier tools. This couldn’t be any further from the truth. Where the focus of System Admin is rather operative and maintenance-focused - fixing things once they go wrong - there is a lack of coding skills and a more strategic, long term solution.

However, I must emphasise: System admin **cannot** be replaced! The role is still very much needed. Errors will still occur, and System Admins are vital for daily operations and maintenance, and DevOps cannot and should not replace Ops people. Instead DevOps should be seen as the bridge to make the lives of developers and system admin a lot easier. 

## … so what is DevOps?

DevOps removes the incompatibility between development and product environment by creating code/using tools that automates and speeds up the tasks of sys admin. Previously sysadmin would have server management limitations, as they would have to complete lots of fixes, restructurings, deployments and small bits and pieces manually. With devops, these things are automated and updates/fixes can be applied to all servers automatically rather than one-by-one manually. This means fewer tedious tasks and limitations for system admin, and they will be able to focus their full energy on server management and other maintenance tasks. For developers this means that whatever code they write it will always fit into the actual product environment, meaning less rework and more time to focus on creating and developing. 

DevOps is not a replacement for people, but a tool and job function improving workflow processes, infrastructure, product performance through testing and fixing. Ultimately it’s faster time to market, improved response times to customer demand, scalability and a much nicer IT environment to work in. 

## DevOps Keywords and Glossary:

So what tools do DevOps use? The absolute top buzzwords to look out for are Docker, Chef, Puppet and Ansible, which are all configuration tools. However, for a more detailed insight in keywords and tools, Honeypot has created the following glossary.
