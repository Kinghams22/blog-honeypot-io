How do US cities compare to European cities when it comes to the average time to hire developers? We compared survey data of Silicon Valley, New York, London, Amsterdam and Berlin  with our own Honeypot averages and the results are pretty interesting...

For developers searching for a job, it is quicker, on average, to find one in Europe than in North America. From our sample, job hunting developers in New York will wait the longest before finding their next position and developers looking for jobs in London will be the quickest.

The most interesting finding, is developers who use Honeypot find a job within 29 days, far faster than the average in all cities. Honeypot is currently active in Berlin and Hamburg and is in beta stages in Amsterdam and Munich.
