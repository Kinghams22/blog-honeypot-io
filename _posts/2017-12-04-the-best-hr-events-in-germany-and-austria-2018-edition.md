### Conclusion

For HR professionals, CTOs and founders, [Honeypot](https://www.honeypot.io/lp/join) is the quickest, easiest and most efficient way to find skilled developers. 

Before founding **Honeypot**, we were just like you: tired of trawling through CVs, frustrated by direct outreach, bored of job postings. Annoyed by these inefficiencies, we built a platform which connects developers and companies directly, giving transparency and speed to both sides. To give you an example, developers on Honeypot have a 90% response rate and it takes an average of 25 days to make a hire. 

Today, Honeypot is Europe’s leading developer-focused job platform, serving Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Cologne, Amsterdam and London. 

The only question that remains: are you ready to join us on our mission to get every developer a great job?
