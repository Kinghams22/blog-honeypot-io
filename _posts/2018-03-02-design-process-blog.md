An amazing design is crucial for the success of any product. Seeking to understand more about this process, and the many individuals that change and influence what the end user will eventually see, I sat down witha Product Designer, Frontend Developer, and UX designer to get their take on the process. 

However, the finished result is rarely the same as the idea that started it.  The vision o

  Q: What’s your favorite part about being a product designer? 
   <br /> 
    <br /> 


A: Defining what the product actually is, what the user stories are, and taking that through to a highly polished end product. As a product designer you take responsibility for actually building the right product for the user and for the business. I focus on making sure the product delivers what it's supposed to and I take responsibility for the product design and implementation process from beginning to end. I rely on developers for the technical aspect of any project. It’s very important for design and development teams to work very closely together so that designers better understand what’s technically possible and what constraints there are for the developers. You learn this through experience working with developers on design projects. 

 <br />  <br /> 

Q: 
How often are you shot-down by developers when you bring them an idea or concept? 

 <br /> 

 <br /> 
 
Answer: 
I definitely wouldn’t use the term shot-down. During the product definition phase we review all the research that we’ve got, and focus on what the business is trying to achieve. Our research will point us to what the users want. Then we can define what the product priorities are and the concepts needed to bring them into reality. The entire team is involved (developers, product owners, designers, QA). Having open and constant dialogue between the designers and developers is important. Once the whole team agrees, we move into development.

 <br />   <br /> 

Q: Is product design synonymous with UX design? 

 <br />  <br /> 

Everyone uses different terms for different things. I would say that a UI designer is somebody that is focused purely on the aesthetics. A UX designer is someone focused on the steps of the user, the user story and the steps and goals of the user and how they will achieve them. Often, someone is a UX/UI designer at the same time and they are covering both of those things.

Q:When did you know you wanted to be a UX designer?

 <br />  <br /> 

Good question. I guess it was when I realized that being a developer isn’t the best way to go about creating products and that as a designer I had more influence over what we’re building, how and why.

 <br />  <br /> 

Q: What is the distinction between frontend development and UX design?

 <br />  <br /> 

These are inherently two distinct roles in product development. That said frontend developer should also be responsible for user experience, as should the whole team/organization. User experience is not a one man responsibility even though in many cases it’s a one man job.

 <br />  <br /> 

Q: Would being a frontend developer and user experience designer all in one be more efficient?

 <br />  <br /> 

Absolutely not. I feel that user experience designers need to have some coding skills (basic HTML and CSS) in order to make their own work easier. Frontend developers should also be responsible for user experience and have some techniques that would make their work easier. However, one person frontend developer and user experience designer would, in my opinion, not be able to produce quality work.

 <br />  <br /> 

Q: What excites you about the future of design?

 <br />  <br /> 

The future of design actually scares me quite a bit. I think we, as designers, have made a big pile of mostly unnecessary things and now we are trying to design other unnecessary things to fix the mess we made. I also think that, apart from a few individuals, we’re failing at it. It would take some serious work to reverse this, and I’m afraid that humanity’s current state of mind is not up to it.

  Q: What is the working relationship is like between frontend developers and UX designers? 

 <br />  <br /> 

Developer serves technical/himself
Designer serves user

The underlying issue for any designer/developer relationship is the goal of each role. Design is about creating a beautiful, unified, multiple touch point experiences. A developer, on the other hand, has c 
A developer wants to: 
- The impetus of both of these roles, and let’s not call it UX design but rather product management/design because it also includes visual design as well. Product design and product coding are counteracting each other. I’ve been a software engineer, I started out as a software engineer (so he has an authority to talk about this). 
-You’ve got deadlines, code is fundamentally unknowable and unmanageable. You cannot estimate how long projects will take more than two weeks in advance. That’s why we do AGILE. 
-The moment a developer tries to do a horizon (estimate) beyond two weeks. It is pie in teh sky, they are basically lying. Because software is basically unknowable as you write it. The bugs you encounter and the structure that you need, you actually do not know it. Unless you break it down into little tasks and don’t look past two weeks. 

-Design on the other hand is about creating these beautiful, unified, service multiple touch point experiences. And you have to break it down into these little bits. And if you are a developer, you are always going to break it down into little bits that serve you as a developer, not that serve the user within their needs. 

So as a developer you will think about what’s practical, what’s doable and time-wise smart. Where a designer would focus rather on the user flow, what will make their use of the product more enjoyable?
-Right. And we also have to break it down into little tasks (as developers) and we work with JIRA as well (tool for project management). We have to write user stories, which if done properly, have to come from the point of view of the user. And not of I need to hit my user story mark right. 
-So if you have this designer/developer, and these Unicorns do exist. I’ve met two of them in twenty years who were very good at both. 


Q: So they are few and far between? 

-Yes they are very few and far between. And they are best as creative technologists, in that they end up in an agency making amazing weird prototypes and discovering stuff. It’s a waste of time to make them do a production level software. Because as said there is inherent contradiction there. 
-On the other side of that spectrum is a design team and development team as far away from each other as possible, maybe even different continents. 
-Right, an offshore development and design team. For the spectrum, being one and the same person to working across the world from one another. 
Would the sweet spot then be colocation?
-Colocation does help, but it can also be virtual colocation. Which is a very weird word. I;ve started to see it using slack. Or having skype permanently on. 
-Colocation is the sweet spot because you don’t want to design something that noone can deliver. And that’s the problem, when do you bring them in. 
Do you feel, as a designer that you are limited by the developers. That your vision is limited. 
-I don’t want to label developers this adversarially. It’s always, we (as designers) want more research, want more testing. More knowledge. They say: Limited amount of time. If the relationship is good then this can work. 
-The goal it to find user stories that developers can use. It’s not so much that we are adversarial, we are just under different constraints. 
-So our bosses, clients, whatever, they always want to see results but they want the perfect mythical unified experience which doesn’t really exist. 
-Developers are under pressure to deliver in a certain amount of time during a certain sprint. We have to work together quite intensely to make this happen. 

What do you see is the future of design? 
What are you excited about, where is it going. 
 
-The future of design is far more conceptual and strategic because the Robots are going to take over, more and more of the grunt work. 
-We are seeing that in the way everyone is trying to create their own design language and designs systems. We’re seeing how the tool providers have caught onto that. 
-You can see that Sketch and InVision. They are focused on tools which allow visual designers, not UX designers but visual designers, to define things like this is my font this is my button, a whole unique design system. And then hook that very closely to reusable pieces of code. And InVision is about to release a chunk of that, SKetch has already been doing that with it’s own version of libraries and Zeppelin. 
- What we are seeing as the future of design, which we have talked about in Berlin. Is that developers start creating reusable pieces of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that are then turned into visual representations which designers can easily turn around and move around on pages, and choose what kind of page layout to have, which is then very little work that translates to the developer after these adjustments. 
- So where we are going is, the name of the game in software and engineering is reusability. Don’t code the same button twice. 
-It’s a better return on investment. The human is the most expensive part. 
Would this reusable code, eventually produce more unicorns, because you will have designers becoming less dependant on developers?
-Potentially but they will still have that same problem of the contradictory needs of designers and developers. 
-Designers are advocating for the user. Developers also advocate for the user, but need to get it done in time in a medium that is inherently unpredictable. I really compare software engineering to making sand castles. 
-You really don’t know how it is going to go. Every knew framework promises everything, and then every new framework is not perfect. 
It has bugs and problems?
-Absolutely! There is very little that is tried and tested, and that was even true in teh 1990’s. There was no golden age when this was all done right, it’s always been developers trudging thru and doing the best the can. Developers show and I understand the frustration and that’s why I work so well with them. 
-Of showing up with 27 pages of subtly different buttons, I’ve got three weeks. wtf!?
-I don’t see those tools getting rid of anyone in the process. But helping people who come from different backgrounds to work better together, and get even faster. I’d rather be able to deliver a quality page than have 2 wireframe pages in a day. 

There is a spectrum of the working relationship, from the unicorn which is a designer and developer in one, all the way to two teams on different continents. In 20 years I have only met 2 people who could both design and develop well. Usually, they are good at one and terrible at the other.
