Every developer who signs up on Honeypot has a call with a Talent Rep and needs to  complete a code review before becoming visible to companies. 15% of people who signup make it to this point because Honeypot is where the best developers meet the best companies! 

And even better, Honeypot provides free visa support to all developers relocating from outside of the EU who get hired over our platform.
