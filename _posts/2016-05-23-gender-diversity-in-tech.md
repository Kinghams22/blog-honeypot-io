# Gender Diversity in Tech

Feminism and diversity are topics that are not only close to my heart - They are key elements forming the very foundation of Honeypot as an organisation. In fact, we hosted our third HR in Tech event last Wednesday 18th May, with the main attraction a panel discussion amongst selected Berlin start-ups and organisations on the topic [“diversity in tech”][3]{:target="_blank"}.

### Initiatives in Berlin

We Honeypotters actively seek, participate and involve ourselves in the gender diversity and equality topic, and we frequently attend debates, conferences and meetups around Berlin such as  [“Women Who Code”][1]{:target="_blank"} or [“Role Models”][4]{:target="_blank"}. Therefore it felt only natural to tie up loose ends with this piece, which will evaluate two significant TED Talks on women in tech in the context of our own panel discussion and a recent Role Model meetup featuring ["Katharina Borchert"][6]{:target="blank"}, the new Chief Innovation Officer at Mozilla. Ms. Borchert is a pretty inspirational women with her many tales and experiences, which has shaped her as leader and a woman.

### Teach Girls Bravery - Not Perfection

The first TED Talk is called [“Teach Girls Bravery - Not Perfection”][2]{:target="_blank"}, and it perfectly explains what I’ve heard just too many times before: girls are conditioned to be perfect and well-behaved, while boys are encouraged to take risks, compete and “seek danger”. The result? Well, it goes deeper than girls playing with Barbies and boys with cars and guns - it follows us into adulthood, and the effects are uncanny. An example brought up both in the TED Talk and by Katharina Borchert is how differently men and women approach job applications; men will apply for any job, even if they only fit 60% of the description, while women will only apply for jobs if they posses 100% of the desired skills and qualifications. 

So much potential is lost because women lack courage and businesses don’t know how to engage them. This topic was brought up several times during HR in Tech - both through audience questions regarding the best ways of attracting female developers, but also within the panel the discussion touched upon the importance of mentoring, encouraging open dialogue not to mention the importance of avoiding non-inclusive language amongst colleagues. 

### Why Do Ambitious Women Have Flat Heads?

This leads us to the second TED Talk [“Why do Ambitious Women have Flat Heads?”][5]{:target="_blank"} by Dame Stephanie Shirley - an incredible women who established the first all-women, tech company in the 1960’s, when there were no real opportunities for women to build a career. She was met by a lot of resistance, both because of the nature of the company (selling software in a time, when software was given away for free with hardware) and for being a women. She eventually reached a stage where she would call herself “Steve” just to get a foot in the door, and she was constantly met with excuses for why her company wasn’t a “real business”. When the company first launched it was faced with the criticism “it only works because it’s small”, after substantial growth the argument was “there’s no strategy - until the company was valued at 3 billion dollars and businessmen finally caved in saying “Well done, Steve”. 

### Being the "Odd one Out"

Stephanie Shirley has experienced sexism and prejudice in a way that most women today can’t even imagine. Yet, here we are 50+ years later, and women still have to fight to prove their worth. Is it any wonder women terrified of failing, considering the structure of business today? Women are highly underrepresented, and many times women tend to be the “odd one out” amongst men - Katharina Borchert described it as “being exotic”. And it’s not restricted to the managerial functions alone - gender diversity has to be represented throughout the entire organisation starting with the recruitment process, ensuring women feel included. 

In conclusion, it’s only natural that women want to ensure that they as the only female represent their gender in the best possible way avoiding any mistakes or errors - but why? The benefits of diversity in business are unquestionable: significantly higher profits, superior performance, better understanding and alignment with customer needs - ["and the list goes on"][7]{:target="_blank"}.
