Since Donald Trump was elected President of the United States in January of 2017, American Developers have signed up to Honeypot at a 50% higher rate. Honeypot is Europe’s leading developer-focused job platform. Is Trump inadvertently encouraging American developers to move abroad?

President Trump’s history of vexing the science and tech communities, has alienated many American developers. This is reflected internationally in how people around the world view the U.S. According to the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/), recent surveys have shown that the global opinion of Americans is getting worse since Trump was elected president:

### Brain Drain?

If American developers begin abandoning the States, then Silicon Valley and other tech heavy areas in the U.S. could experience a [Brain Drain](Motherboard.com). Wikipedia defines Brain Drain as [“Human Capital Flight”](en.wikipedia.org), which means that the highly skilled workers of a nation are leaving their home for opportunities abroad. They take with them their education and skills, which are used for future innovations and which benefit their new host country. 

### No More Silicon Valley?

Silicon Valley may soon be uprooted by the likes of London or Berlin, with America’s position as a technological forerunner losing ground at an even faster pace since Trump took office. In 2017, [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/chart/7246/the-countries-with-the-fastest-internet/) ranked the U.S. in last place on the top ten list for Fastest Internet connection speeds.

### Top Cities For Startups

Speaking of top ten lists, 5 out of the top 10 best cities for startups are in the U.S. but London at #3 and Berlin at #7 have been moving up the list. Because of this, [Europe is looking increasingly more attractive to developers with a wandering eye.](thenextweb.com) To American developers, these cities are exotic, offer exciting new career opportunities, and are even English accessible.

### Summary

European developers may see some added competition from the arrival of so many American software developers. However, this opportunity for collaboration and innovation is likely a very good thing for Europe’s standing in the tech industry.
