### Berlin and London Growing as Startup Destinations

According to [Startup Genome](https://startupgenome.com/), five out of the top 10 best cities for startups are in the U.S. but London, at #3, and Berlin, at #7, have been moving up the list:

London moved up three places from its ranking last year, and Berlin advanced two places. Both cities offer great market reach along with reliable funding sources. Because of this, [Europe is looking increasingly more attractive to American developers.](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/05/01/global-startup-ecosystem-report-2017/#.tnw_w5T4slht) European cities offer exciting new career opportunities and many startups and tech companies operate in English. Check out our [startup map of Berlin](http://blog.honeypot.io/berlin-startup-map) and [London](http://blog.honeypot.io/london-tech-map/) to see where startups are concentrated within each city.

### London

London is well-known for its Fintech sector, but also has a 'Silicon Roundabout' (Old Street Roundabout) bustling with startups. London is the cultural hub of Great Britain and is extremely diverse with more than half of Londoners from [various countries and nationalities](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2950401/How-one-three-Londoners-born-abroad-areas-live-in.html) in many parts of the city as reported by [Martin Robinson](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2950401/How-one-three-Londoners-born-abroad-areas-live-in.html). 

London boasts almost daily Meetups and 2-3 Hackathons a week. These are usually peer-organized and feed a huge computer enthusiast scene. London further benefits from other cities nearby, such as Birmingham which is just a £12 train ride away. 

### Amsterdam

The city of canals has a ton to offer: Amsterdam itself is famous for great bars and nightlife while corporations such as Uber, Tesla, Elastic and Atlassian have major offices here. 

Amsterdam also boasts a history of tech innovation with homegrown software and security companies such as Booking.com, Gemalto, and TomTom. Our [Amsterdam Tech Map](http://blog.honeypot.io/amsterdam-tech-map/) demonstrates more of the advantages Amsterdam has for international developers, such as the 2nd highest non-native English proficiency globally. 

### Berlin 

Once nicknamed the 'poorest capital of Europe' Berlin has never looked back by becoming a European heaven for working with new technologies while remaining a cheap place to live. Berlin's tech scene features everything from machine learning to E-commerce, and offers a very high standard of life. Salaries won't match what you would find in London or Amsterdam, but the cheaper cost of living means that the quality of life can actually be higher. Lastly, Berlin has natural beauty thanks to numerous parks and recreational areas. 





### Europe a Land of Opportunity For Developers

According to [Dan Hynes](https://medium.com/@danhynes/there-s-no-tech-talent-shortage-in-europe-there-s-a-smart-hiring-shortage-f9fab43a761e), Europe is primed for tech professionals to find new positions in their industry.  European companies hope to take advantage of the tech talent increase by adding new individuals with tech skills their teams may have been missing.

European countries offer incentives for technology specialists to come into the workforce. In the Netherlands, highly trained and skilled expats qualify for a tax reduction of 30% thanks to a [Dutch tax ruling](http://blog.honeypot.io/30-percent-tax-dutch-ruling/). The [Blue Card](http://blog.honeypot.io/EU-Bluecard-for-software-developers/) is an easy way for non-EU nationals to live and work in Europe, with many European Union countries adopting the visa. Germany is leading the way issuing 85% of the total number of Blue Cards between 2012-2014.

A study by [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/chart/7246/the-countries-with-the-fastest-internet/) even showed Europe with five of the top 10 fastest internet connections by country in 2017. In contrast, the U.S. was ranked number 10.

With so many great European cities to choose from, the only difficulty is trying to decide which one best suits you! Let us help you out, by signing up at [Honeypot.io](https://www.honeypot.io/pages/how_it_works).

### Summary

With mature markets in London and Amsterdam, both cities offer developers and tech talent alike the chance to advance their careers and work on projects they love. Berlin, however, may be the best city for those looking for a more untraditional approach to tech due to the number of startups to choose from. Whichever city they choose, the arrival of more American software developers, and the additional opportunities for collaboration and innovation, will be a very good thing for Europe’s standing in the tech industry.
