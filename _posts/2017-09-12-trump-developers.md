### Europe a Land of Opportunity For Developers

According to [Medium-Post](https://medium.com/@danhynes/there-s-no-tech-talent-shortage-in-europe-there-s-a-smart-hiring-shortage-f9fab43a761e), Europe is primed for tech professionals to find new positions in their industry.  European companies hope to take advantage of the tech talent increase which will help them fill in missing skillsets from their teams.

European countries offer incentives for technology specialists to come into the workforce. In the Netherlands, highly trained and skilled expats qualify for a tax reduction of 30% thanks to a [Dutch tax ruling](http://blog.honeypot.io/30-percent-tax-dutch-ruling/). The [Blue Card](http://blog.honeypot.io/EU-Bluecard-for-software-developers/) is an easy way for non-EU Nationals to live and work in Europe, with many European Union countries adopting the policy. Germany leads the way with this policy, issuing 85% of the total number of Blue Cards between 2012-2014.
