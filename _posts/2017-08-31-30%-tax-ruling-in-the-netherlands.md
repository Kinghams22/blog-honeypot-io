One way the Netherlands is trying to attract high level talent is through their 30% tax ruling. This rule in simple terms, entitles employees who are new to the Netherlands to a 30% tax exemption of their gross annual salary once they meet certain conditions. The ruling is intended to be used as a means of reimbursing the employee for costs incurred through the relocation process, however neither the employee nor employer is required to provide evidence of any costs incurred in order to prove eligibility for this allowance. Here is our breakdown of what is required and how it works:

### 30% Dutch Tax Ruling Application Requirements  

**1.** You must be recruited or transferred from a country outside of the Netherlands, and you must have been living more than 150 kilometres in a straight line from the Dutch border for 16 of the 24 months prior to your first day of employment in the Netherlands. There are [exceptions](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/living_and_working/working_in_another_country_temporarily/you_are_coming_to_work_in_the_netherlands/30_facility_for_incoming_employees/conditions_30_p_facility/you_live_more_than_150_kilometres_away_from_the_dutch_border) to this rule for anyone that has completed a PhD.  

**2.** You must be deemed to possess specific expertise that is scarce on the Dutch employment market. **These expert skillsets are not listed on the application, nor are they defined by industry or qualification.** If your gross salary (for 2017) is greater than €37,000 after the 30% rule has been applied, you possess much needed specific skills.   For example, assume the gross annual salary of a developer is €100,000 before the 30% rule is applied. The employee and employer can agree to pay 30% of this amount as a tax free allowance, €30,000, meaning the taxable gross salary amounts to €70,000. This figure is acceptable for the rule to be implemented as the taxable salary is above the required €37,000.   If however, you are under the age of 30 and possess a Master’s degree, the required taxable salary (for 2017) after the 30% rule is applied is €28,125.   If you are working in the Netherlands at a research institution conducting scientific research, you are entitled to the 30% ruling regardless of your salary.  

**3.** If approved, the ruling has a term of 8 years. There are some [conditions](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/living_and_working/working_in_another_country_temporarily/you_are_coming_to_work_in_the_netherlands/30_facility_for_incoming_employees/the_decision_issued_to_you_has_a_maximum_term_of_8_years) which may shorten the duration if you have previously worked in the Netherlands in the last 25 years.   If you change employer during this term, it is possible to apply to continue the ruling with the agreement of your new employer, so long as the same requirements are met and there **is a gap of no more than three months between jobs.  **

**4.** Along with the obvious financial benefit of the 30% ruling, there are some **further perks: You can avoid paying taxes** on certain assets as you are eligible to select ‘non-resident status’ when filing your income tax as a non resident taxpayer.  

**5.** If you are already working in the Netherlands and fulfil the criteria for eligibility but have not applied for the ruling, **it is possible to retroactively apply**. If you have not yet been working in your qualifying job for 4 months, the retroactive ruling will entitle you to back payments from the date your employment began. If you have been in your position for more than 4 months, the ruling will become effective on the first of the month after your successful application. 

### Getting a Dutch Driving License

While most people must take a test to gain a Dutch driving license, you and your family members are **entitled to exchange existing driving licenses for a Dutch license** without needing to take a test.  If agreed with your employer you can also be reimbursed for any school [fees](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/living_and_working/working_in_another_country_temporarily/you_are_coming_to_work_in_the_netherlands/30_facility_for_incoming_employees/school_fees) which may have been incurred.      

### How To Apply

**1.** You and your employer must agree that you are eligible and willing to apply for the ruling.

**2.** Together with your employer you must complete the [application form](https://download.belastingdienst.nl/belastingdienst/docs/applic_2017_Inc_tax_nat_insur_lh5981z71foleng.pdf) and return it to the Belastingdiesnt (Tax Administration).

**3.** Include the required documentation. You will need to provide: -Proof of ID other than a Driver’s license.
-Proof of residence 150km from the Dutch border prior to this position.
-A copy of your employment contract in the Netherlands.
-Your Citizen Service Number (BSN).
-Your Dutch address.
-Your employer’s Withholding Tax Number. -Documented proof of your employer as a registered employer in the Netherlands.
-If applicable, documents showing that the employee has obtained a Masters, PhD, or is conducting scientific research with an educational institute.
